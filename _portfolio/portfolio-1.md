title: "Analysis of stem cell migration based on substrate stiffness"
excerpt: "I developed macros in ImageJ to automate analysis of large stacks of images captured under a microscope. I also prepared PDMS polymer gels of different stiffness and characterised their stiffness using buoyant force microscopy - frugal alternative to atomic force microscopy.<br/><img src='/images/pr1.png'>"
