I participated in an industrial learning course where we visited and learnt about plant-layout, process flow diagrams and equipment across the chemical process tree. As part of the course I also developed and contributed to DwSIM flowsheet of Vaccum Gas Oil hydrotreater. DwSIM is an open source alternative to ASPEN simulation software.
