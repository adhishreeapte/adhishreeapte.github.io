Autonomous Underwater Vehicle team at IIT Bombay manufactures robots called Matsya to participate in the international Robosub competition held at San Deigo every year. I worked on the 5th iteration of the vehicle series called Matsya. I was responsible for the design and manufacture of the robotic arm and underwater emergency stop switch. I used SOLIDWORKS for developing the CAD model. ANSYS static structural was used for checking the mechanical integrity of the design. I also explored the use of ANSYS Icepack for improving thermal performance of the electronic stack.
